# 💫 About Me:
I'm a DevOps Engineer with a background in full-stack web development and a passion for automation and problem-solving. My journey into tech began as an expecting father determined to create a better future, and I’ve been pushing boundaries ever since.

🚀 What I Do

- Automation & CI/CD: From suspending dormant accounts to handling webhook integrations with GitHub and Okta, I love streamlining workflows.
- Infrastructure as Code: Working with Terraform to deploy on AWS (like setting up EC2 instances without manual SSH).
- Full-Stack Development: Experience with Node.js, Python, and Docker to build reliable solutions.
- Collaborations: I actively seek new opportunities to connect and create impact with businesses and projects.

🛠️ What I’m Working On

- Continuously learning and honing my skills in DevOps, cloud technologies, and automation tools.

🌱 Fun Facts

- I got my start through a training program at Beach Coders Academy.
- When I’m not coding, I’m either detailing cars, solving puzzles, or learning something new.

Feel free to reach out, connect, or collaborate. 🚀
